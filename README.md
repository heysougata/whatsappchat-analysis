# SP Chat Detective: Uncovering the Secrets of Your WhatsApp Conversations
Developed and designed a user-friendly WhatsApp chat analysis web app using Streamlit that provides
both group and individual person analysis.

- But I thought why not do **Data Analysis on a WhatsApp group chat** of *college students* and find out interesting insights about  features such as media share count, total messages, total words, total link shares, monthly and
daily timelines, busiest day and month, weekly activity map, most active user, word cloud, and the most overused word.
